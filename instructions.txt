What is SDLC?
    SDLC is The Software Development Life Cycle: "A process that produces software with the highest quality and lowest cost in the shortest time possible."

What are the stages of SDLC? explain 
    -Requirement analysis: Take a step back and try to see what's going on. what's good with the system, what's bad with the system, and get other people's input about it.  
    -Planning: Figuring out what you need to have to get this job done this includes materials, Cost, and time.
    -Software design: "starts by turning the software specifications into a design plan called the Design Specification. All stakeholders then review this plan and offer feedback and suggestions."
    -Software development: This is where we actually start making code and building it. Make sure you have an agreed way on code style and practices
    -Testing: In this stage we run the code and see if there's any bugs that we need to fix and see if the code actually does what we want it to.
    -Deployment: This is getting the final product out into the public.

Define five SDLC moldels (methodology).
    -Agile:"The Agile model helps teams identify and address small issues on projects before they evolve into more significant problems, and engage business stakeholders and get their feedback throughout the development process."
    -Lean: "The Lean process is about working only on what must be worked on at the time, so there’s no room for multitasking. Project teams are also focused on finding opportunities to cut waste at every turn throughout the SDLC process, from dropping unnecessary meetings to reducing documentation."
    -Waterfall: "finish one phase, then move on to the next. No going back. Each stage relies on information from the previous stage and has its own project plan."
    -Iterative: "Instead of starting with fully known requirements, project teams implement a set of software requirements, then test, evaluate and pinpoint further requirements and repet." 
    -Spiral: "It enables development teams to build a highly customized product, and incorporate user feedback early on in the project. Each iteration starts by looking ahead to potential risks, and figuring out how best to avoid or mitigate them."
    -DevOps: “DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes.”

Describe how to apply SDLC model in the version control App.
You can apply this in the Version Control app by first taking a step back and actually seeing what you're trying to accomplish. Plan for what you're going to need in cost or time to spend on  the app. Figure out how you want your app to be displayed and how you want it to look and connect to each other.  Then after that you can start writing up the code to replicate what you decided to do in the layout. Then run your app and have people test it out to see if there's any bugs that need to be fixed or if it's getting across the point you wanted it to.  then you can release it to the public and then have them have at it.
