    -Planning: Figuring out what you need to have to get this job done this includes materials, Cost, and time.
    -Software design: "starts by turning the software specifications into a design plan called the Design Specification. All stakeholders then review this plan and offer feedback and suggestions."
    -Software development: This is where we actually start making code and building it. Make sure you have an agreed way on code style and practices
    -Testing: In this stage we run the code and see if there's any bugs that we need to fix and see if the code actually does what we want it to.
    -Deployment: This is getting the final product out into the public.
